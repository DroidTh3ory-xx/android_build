******************************
You have tried to change the Motorola API from what has been previously approved.

To make these errors go away, you have two choices:
   1) You can add "@hide" javadoc comments to the methods, etc. listed in the
      errors above.

   2) You can update mmi-current.txt by executing the following command:
         make mmiupdate-api

      To submit the revised mmi-current.txt (frameworks/base/api/mmi-current.txt) to the main Android repository,
      you will need approval.
